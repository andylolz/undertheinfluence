Under The Influence
===================

Under the Influence is a web application developed to help track the influence of lobbying in politics. The project is commissioned by Spinwatch and Unlock Democracy with additional funding from Greenpeace. In addition to the application improving their ability to research and campaign we hope it will also be a tool for the general public to explore who influences our representatives.
